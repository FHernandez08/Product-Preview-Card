# Product-Preview-Card
Repository for the product preview card


Overview:
  Create the product preview card using HTML and CSS with the files provided.
  
The Challenge:
  Create the design in both desktop (1440px) and mobile (375px) using HTML and CSS with adding a reactive state when interacting with the button.
  
What I learned:
  That being organized in the HTML file, when creating the structure for the project, makes the CSS a lot easier to create and understand where everything is. Also, had a better understanding for using the hover features for the button.
  
 Continued Development:
  I want to continue focusing on the states in CSS when adding buttons or components similar to them. Understanding more about the flexbox vs grid and when to use it.
